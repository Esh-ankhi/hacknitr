# ✈️ Real-Time Aviation Intelligence Chatbot

A real-time, weather-aware aviation intelligence system that tracks live flights, detects airspace congestion, identifies anomalies, and predicts delay risks — all explained in natural language through an AI-powered chatbot.

Instead of complex dashboards, users can simply query a flight number to get instant live status and insights.
